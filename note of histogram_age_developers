The note about histogram_age_developers.png and age_chart.py:

In the histogram, we can see some interesting facts about the ages of developers who took part in the survey:

- About 62% of the developers are younger than 35 years old. This means that a large number of developers are relatively young.

- Around 37.3% of the developers are older than 35 years old. So, there are also many experienced developers in the industry.

- A very small percentage, about 0.5%, chose not to share their age in the survey.

This shows that the IT industry is mainly made up of younger people. Many young individuals are interested in studying and working in technology.

In summary, the histogram helps us understand the different age groups of developers in the industry and how young people are playing a significant role in shaping the future of technology.
