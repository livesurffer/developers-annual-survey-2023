This is a review of the output generated by the "analyse_country.py" module in this project. The code within the module is responsible for manipulating a portion of the data extracted from the developers-annual-survey-2023 on StackOverFlow.

In the StackOverflow survey, 89,184 developers participated, and the survey took place in May 2023, encompassing developers from around the world. Running the "analyse_country.py" script creates two files:
The first one is "pie_chart_devel_country.png," which displays a pie chart representing the proportion of developers residing in each specific country based on the developers' annual survey in 2023.

To ensure accuracy, the data is filtered to exclude countries where less than 2% of developers reside. These excluded countries are listed in the second file, "excluded_countries_list.png."

Looking at the pie chart, the top 10 countries with the highest number of developers are:

1. US - 33.18%
2. Germany - 13.04%
3. India - 10.01% 
4. UK - 9.88%
5. Canada - 6.24%
6. France - 5.22%
7. Poland - 4.33%
8. Netherlands - 4.24%
9. Australia - 3.7%
10. Brazil - 3.63% 

Let's categorize these countries as developed and developing based on data from https://worldpopulationreview.com/. Among the top 10 countries, there are 2 developing countries and 8 developed countries.

1. US - 33.18% developed
2. Germany - 13.04% developed
3. India - 10.01% developing
4. UK - 9.88% developed
5. Canada - 6.24% developed
6. France - 5.22% developed
7. Poland - 4.33% developed
8. Netherlands - 4.24% developed
9. Australia - 3.7% developed
10. Brazil - 3.63% developing


Let's explore the potential connection between the developing IT industry of each country and the count of developers residing there:

Starting with the US, known for its robust IT industry, it comprises 33.18% of the developers on the list, almost three times more than the second-ranked Germany. The US IT market is highly popular among developers, and it actively seeks IT talents.

Germany and the UK, both strong economies in Europe, also boast thriving IT industries that attract developers with their abundant opportunities.

India, a developing country and ranked third on the list, has been heavily investing in its IT industry, making it a significant player in the global tech landscape. It closely trails Germany and the UK with a percentage of 10.01.

n conclusion, the data analysis indicates a correlation between the development of the IT industry in various countries and the count of developers residing there. Countries with robust and growing IT industries tend to attract a higher number of developers, suggesting a potential link between industry development and developer presence. However, further in-depth research and consideration of various factors are required to establish definitive causal relationships between these variables.
P.S. China is also on the list as well, but with only 0.74% of developers. StackOverFlow announced about global world survey but who knows. Anyway Statistic are Statistic.
